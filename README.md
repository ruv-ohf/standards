# Standards/recommendations.

* [STANDARDS](STANDARDS.md)
* [RECOMMENDATIONS](RECOMMENDATIONS.md)


## Difference between standards and recommendations.

Our intent with the standards is to define technical standards.
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard):

    A technical standard is an established norm or requirement in
    regard to technical systems. It is usually a formal document that
    establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods,
    processes and practices.


Our expectation is that we will all follow the standards. If we find
that a standard is not useful or has become an obstacle; we change the
standard. The emphasis on defining standards is to really be careful,
recommending the basic standards we need at gilt to be productive
without being prescriptive about details that actually don't improve
cross team collaboration.

When we talk about standards, we are talking about collaboration with
other teams as well as 3rd parties. From this point of view, our
standards are (deliberately) very basic requirements, mostly
influenced by our combined experiences of working with 3rd
parties. Things that make our lives easier as 'consumers' of 3rd party
APIs are things we now like to do ourselves for our internal APIs as
well. Gilt standards are requirements for work at Gilt.

We also highlight suggestions or recommendations; and they are just
that - you can diverge. We recommend something because we have good
experiences with it, we intend to support it and it gets the job
done. That said, if you think you can do better - that's perfectly
fine, all it means is your team might be on its own and will need to
support the choice.


## Intentions

Our intention here is to provide guidance without imposing too much.
We trust you and your team to have good judgement.
You can treat RECOMMENDATIONS as standards, if you wish, the difference
here is that you *can* diverge if there's a good reason.


## Creating/changing a Standard

[See Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Changes to standards need to get [architecture board's approval](https://github.com/gilt/arch-board/blob/master/README.md#decision-making-process)
